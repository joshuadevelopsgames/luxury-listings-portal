- Notes contain: "contacted", "called", "emailed"
- Has a follow-up date set

### **Cold Leads** (Gray)
- All other leads that don't match warm or contacted criteria
- Usually new leads requiring initial outreach

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

- Make sure you've added `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY` to your `.env` file

## üîí **Security Best Practices**

   - Set appropriate usage quotas

3. **Monitor API usage**
   - Check Google Cloud Console for usage statistics
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity

## üì± **Production Deployment**

When deploying to production:

1. **Set environment variables** in your hosting platform
