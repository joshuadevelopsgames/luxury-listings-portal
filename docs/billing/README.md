# Billing (external – email)

Use these templates outside the app: fill placeholders, then send by email.

- **SUBSCRIPTION_AGREEMENT.md** — Contract: $200 base + $20/user, term, payment terms, user-count updates. Fill [brackets], get both parties to sign, send a copy to the client.
- **INVOICE_TEMPLATE.md** — Monthly invoice. Fill [brackets] (including user count and total: base + users × $20). Save as PDF (e.g. print to PDF from browser/Word) or paste into email; send each month.

No billing page in the app; everything is sent via email.
